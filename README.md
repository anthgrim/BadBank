# Bad Bank - MIT

## App Information

### Title: C-Ash Bank

### Description:

This is the Bad Bank is the Capstone Project for the MIT - Fullstack Development MERN. It is called Bad Bank due to the users data exposured in the UI (intentionally). I changed the name, as I can't resist a pun, to C-Ash Bank, since I am Ash and it looks like Cash... but it's not!

It consists of a simple React application where the students apply concepts such as hooks, context, routing, and form validations. As well, for the first attempt from the students to deploy a React application using AWS S3 Buckets.
